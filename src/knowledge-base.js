* — "Profitability may fluctuate. Drawdowns are possible — this is part of the working process. On average per year, the bot shows good results."

❗️Trading in financial markets involves risks, including possible loss of invested funds. We do not guarantee that future results will be similar to past results. The user independently assumes all risks and does not place responsibility on the project team for possible losses. The information is for informational purposes only and is not individual investment advice.

⚠️ We invite only adequate and conscious people who understand that the bot is a tool, not a magic "make a million" button.

** — 🧳 Participation conditions: how much is needed and how everything is arranged

Transparent. Honest. With respect for your trust.

We believe: every participant should understand what they are entering and what they can count on.

🔹 Minimum entry — $1200
This is the basic threshold at which Wenay Bot can function correctly and bring stable results.

🔹 Recommended deposit — from $3000
At this level, the bot shows maximum efficiency and consistently implements the embedded strategy.

📊 How profit is distributed

💡 Everything is simple: distribution depends on how your account was created on 🔴exchange.

📉 If you registered via someone's referral link — profit split 50/50

📈 If you registered without a referral link — you get 60%, we get 40%

🛠 Why so?
On accounts created via referral link, 🔴exchange imposes certain restrictions that prevent using Wenay Bot to its full potential. This decision is dictated by technical necessity, not a desire to reduce your profit.

💬 We're not about hype and not about "threw in yesterday — doubled today". Wenay is a system created for years ahead. We build a sustainable model where every participant gets transparent conditions and a decent share.

❗️Important! We don't have access to withdraw funds from your account, so at the end of the reporting period you transfer our share yourself. Details from your curator.

⚠️ Each user will be charged an additional monthly fee of 1500 rubles for server rental, except for those who registered an account on 🔴exchange after January 2022 without using a referral link.
(Thanks to special 🔴exchange commissions for these accounts and our partnership conditions, we receive income from trading volume that covers server rental for this account.)

❗️DO NOT TAKE LOANS TO INVEST IN THE BOT

🚨 ATTENTION: BE VIGILANT 🚨

Scammers don't sleep — they distort our project and may impersonate team members.

🔒 Here's what we NEVER do:

❗Don't ask to transfer money in advance — only after receiving profit
❗Don't ask to enable "allow withdrawal" checkbox when connecting API
❗Don't request passport data or any other personal information

📩 If you have doubts about the person who invited you, or you received a message with something from the above:

1. Don't take any action
2. Send their link to our support: @wenaysupport (https://t.me/wenaysupport)
3. Wait for identity confirmation

⚠️ Even if support confirms the person's identity — still NEVER transfer money in advance, Don't enable "allow withdrawal" checkbox and Don't share personal data. These actions are always strictly prohibited.

❗️Write to support only about security and connection issues. You'll find answers to all other questions in FAQ or can clarify with your curator.

FAQ:

🔤 Bot operation principle
The bot doesn't use any trend strategies, martingale methods or other nonsense that fills the market in its algorithm. The basis: volume tracking, rebalancing, Dynamic Rolling matrix correlation, services that are activated depending on exchange news: token swap, listing or delisting, plus a bunch of proprietary features. Only spot trading, no futures.

🔤 How long has the bot been working?
The bot was launched in 2022. After that, we rewrote its engine twice for maximum stability. Tests were conducted on real client accounts. At peak, the total amount of money in operation was almost $1.5 million.

🔤 Why is profit shared in percentage?
We don't sell bot subscriptions and don't take prepayment. Instead, we chose an honest model — we share profit, like in trust management. You pay our share yourself only based on successful work results, after the settlement period.
📌 Why so? Because we ourselves are tired of "gurus" selling courses, signals, access and subscriptions to things that don't work. We don't want to be part of this circus. Our principle — we earn only if you earn.

🔤 Is trading conducted on my account?
Yes, no need to transfer money anywhere. Work is done through API on a dedicated server. You just need to register the server IP address in your exchange personal account, set a couple of checkboxes, uncheck withdrawal access, and give us two keys.

🔤 How safe are my data and funds?
We don't have access to withdraw funds from your account. You only provide API keys with limited rights — even in case of hacking, no one can withdraw money. Everything is under your control. Our servers are protected by the same protocols as major banks.

🔤 Do you trade with high leverage on futures?
No, we don't trade futures with high leverage. We conduct trading on the SPOT market with maximum leverage x1.5, using cross margin. This allows us to minimize risks and provide more stable and safe trading conditions plus allows shorting.

🔤 Why do we recommend 🟣exchange and can other exchanges be used?
We chose this exchange because of the largest daily trading volumes. You can also use another 🟣exchange but profitability there is significantly lower.

🔤 Do I need to pay for server rental?
Yes. Monthly you will transfer us 1500 rubles for server rental on which trading is conducted for your account. Only those who registered an account on 🟣exchange after January 2022 without using a referral link don't pay.

🔤 Why is the fee not charged from those who registered on 🟣exchange after January 2022 and without referral?
For such accounts, special conditions apply that allow us to cover expenses without additional payment from your side — thanks to technical features of bot operation.

🔤 What to do if there's no account on 🟣exchange?
If you're in Russia ❗️ Register a new account with a foreign passport. The main thing is to specify another country and residential address. Through the web version of the site from a computer. When registering from a smartphone, the exchange often automatically attaches the account to someone's referral link. If you need help with address verification — contact your curator.

🔤 If I change my account on 🟣exchange, will the server fee be canceled and profit sharing conditions changed if I previously had an account with a referral link?
Yes, they will be. Contact your curator for details.

🔤 I already have an old 🟣account registered via referral link. What to do if I want to use the bot on more favorable terms?
In this case, you can create a new account in the name of a close person — for example, a relative with a foreign passport. The main thing: specify another country of residence.
❗️Important: register a new account only through the web version of the site from a computer or laptop.
When registering via smartphone, 🟣exchange often automatically attaches the account to a random referral link — even if you didn't enter it manually.

🔤 How else can I register an account on 🟣exchange if I don't have relatives with foreign passports?
You can delete your old Binance account through the app, and after half an hour register it again from a computer with the same data, using your foreign passport.

🔤 How does protection against drawdown above 30% work?
We limit risk for the investor: maximum drawdown — 30%. If the loss on your account exceeds this threshold (for example, drawdown -35%), we cover the difference (in this case 5%) — from distributing part of our profit or reserves.
This rule applies when key conditions are met:
•You don't exit the strategy before the end of the investment term (3 months)
•Bot works according to standard configuration, without interference
•Drawdown is fixed on closed positions, not temporary volatility

This is not an insurance company, but a real system of collective responsibility: we bear part of the risks together with the client — because it's unprofitable for us for you to lose money.

🔤 What if I only have $500?
Yes, we can add you to an experimental group with minimum deposit amount. However, it's important to understand:
- Profitability in such a group is many times lower than in the main pool.
- You'll still have to pay for server rental, even if the bot doesn't bring profit.
- As a result, you might not earn anything at all — this is more of a "get acquainted and see" format, not full participation.
If you're focused on results, we recommend starting with $1200 and above.

🔤 What does "Profitability may fluctuate. Drawdowns are possible" mean?
The market is unstable, and there are periods when the bot enters work at an unfortunate moment — for example, during a sharp trend change. In such a situation, drawdown may appear from the very beginning.
This is normal: the bot adapts and levels out the result over time.
It's important not to panic — the strategy is designed for the long term.
On average per year, the bot shows stable profitability, despite temporary fluctuations.

🔤 What if I want to add money to the account?
No problem, just warn your curator first to reset the settlement period and transfer our share for the past period.
You can add as much as you want and whenever you want. Usually people start with small amounts (up to 50k), and then increase — when they feel confident.

🔤 When and how to pay your share of profit?
Usually the settlement period is 1 calendar month. At the end of the month, you contact your curator, you sum up the results, and then you manually transfer our share to the account your curator will specify. We don't withdraw it automatically — you control the process. We recommend increasing the settlement period to 3-6 months, compound interest will give more profit.

🔤 Can I invite friends?
Yes, we have a partnership program: you get 10% of the profit of everyone you invited. Forever. Without MLM and without multi-level schemes.

🔤 What does it mean that you work not only with USDT?
If you have top coins (for example, BTC, ETH), we can work with them without the need to sell. Trading is conducted through their USDT equivalent — you get profit in USDT, and the coins remain in your account and retain growth potential.

Common Objections and Answers:

Is this a scam or pyramid?
- I understand your concerns, there's a lot of deception in crypto. This is neither a scam nor a pyramid. Wenay Bot is an automated tool for spot trading, from a team with huge experience. Check reviews and cases in the channel. And you can make sure of this by connecting. Money will remain in your account, no need to transfer it anywhere. We connect the bot to your account, and when connecting you don't check the box that we have access to withdraw funds. And you pay us only after you receive profit with our help. No need to pay anything upfront. You are fully insured.

Too low profitability — is this unrealistic?
- I agree, 5-15% per month sounds low at first glance, especially compared to 20% annually from banks. However, if you understand, then with compound interest 5-15% per month turns into 100% annually. Feel the difference?

Risks of losing money?
- Your caution is understandable, the market is volatile. Wenay Bot uses spot trading without margin calls, so the deposit doesn't "fly away". In addition, we insure your deposit against loss of funds, our manager can tell you the details!

Commission 40-50% — is this a lot?
- I understand, half the profit seems like a big amount. But you only pay from income, and you don't personally engage in trading, consider it the salary of your "employee" who works for you absolutely without sleep. For this money, the bot does everything for you, unlike competitors with fixed payment.

Is it difficult to connect?
- I see you're worried about the technical side — this is normal. Connection is 5 simple steps: you top up cross margin, create API, send to curator, then he does everything himself. We'll help at every stage, personal curator is always at hand on the phone!

Do I need trading knowledge?
- I understand, without experience it can be scary. But with Wenay Bot you don't need knowledge — it trades itself after connection. Curators and support chat will help beginners figure it out!

Bot doesn't work on other exchanges?
- I agree, the limitation to Binance and ByBit can be annoying. We chose leaders by volume for best results. We're testing new ones, but for now the focus is on reliability — this is a plus for you!

What if the exchange blocks the account?
- Your concern is understandable, bans happen. We use API with restrictions (only trading, no withdrawal), risk is minimal. If anything, curator will help restore access!

Long wait for income?
- I understand, you want quick money. With Wenay average growth is 5-15% per month, here the story will be exactly about discipline and patience. Over 2.5 years of testing, the result is stable (about 100% annually) — patience will pay off!

Can I withdraw funds?
- I see you want confidence in access. Yes, withdrawal is possible at any moment: transfer from cross margin to deposit wallet and withdraw, but consider system commission and minimum $1200 for correct bot operation.

Is the referral system MLM?
- I understand your doubts, pyramids are annoying. We have a simple referral system: 10% of referral income, without levels. Pure benefit for invitations! First of all, you help loved ones start earning. But if you don't want to invite anyone, it's not required. You can earn individually. The referral system only gives additional income.

Minimum $1200 — why so much?
- I see the amount seems high. This is the minimum for stable algorithm operation. Start small, but bigger deposit — higher absolute income. Look at examples in reviews.

Does commission change?
- Commission depends on the "referral nature" of the exchange account itself and the year when you registered it. Everything is simple here: registered via someone's link - 50% commission (instead of 40%), if the account was registered after 2023 and without referral link - 40% commission.

What will happen if there's a drawdown above 30%?
- I understand your concerns about drawdown above 30% — this is indeed a serious moment. With Wenay Bot you can be calm: we take responsibility and cover losses more than 30% if they arise based on trading results over 3 months. The bot uses spot trading without margin lending, and our team analyzes the market to minimize risks. Connect, and our curators will help set everything up for your goals!

Guarantees?
- I understand, you want to be sure of your investments — this is absolutely normal. With Wenay Bot we offer real guarantees: your funds remain in your Binance/ByBit account, and the bot works only through API without withdrawal rights. We cover losses more than 30% if they happen over 3 months of trading, and use proven algorithms with 2-year backtest. Plus, postpayment — you pay only from profit, and our curators are always in touch to help. Check cases in the channel and see for yourself! 😊

Better go to the bank?
- I understand, you value bank reliability and the ability to manage your money — let's figure it out! With a bank deposit at 20% annually, it's not that simple: many deposits are tied to terms (3-12 months), and early withdrawal burns interest or part of capital, plus you need to notify the bank 30-90 days in advance. Bureaucracy, queues and withdrawal limits create barriers. With $1200 you'll get about +$240 per year, but real income will be reduced by taxes and inflation.
With Wenay Bot everything is simpler: at 15% per month (net 9% after 40% postpayment) with $1200 you can reach +$1369 per year. Stop the bot at any moment through personal account, stop cooperation without paperwork — funds remain in your Binance/ByBit account, and you withdraw them when you want. There is risk, but freedom and control are on your side! 😊
